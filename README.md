# mecco_dara

Dara is a MODO kit of MODO kits. Its sole purpose is to simplify the download and installation of its member kits. It was originally developed by Mechanical Color LLC as a proprietary paid product, and is now released as open-source under the MIT license.

This repository does not contain all of the Dara member kits. Instead, it contains a Python script for cloning and assembling the kits into a given release of Dara.

If you would prefer to download Dara as a turnkey package:

If you would prefer to install the kits individually:
